Project:Student Grade Tracker

Objective:
To implement a system that efficiently processes student marks and
provides an accurate assessment of their performance.

Technologies Used:
Java Servlets: For server-side processing.
HTML/CSS: For the front-end interface.
Apache Tomcat: As the web server.

Execution Flow:
User Input: The user enters the student name and marks in the HTML form.
Form Submission: The form data is submitted to the GradeServlet.
Data Processing: The servlet processes the input data, calculates the
total and average marks, and determines the grade.

The Student Track Grader project successfully demonstrates the creation of a
 web-based application using Java Servlets and JSP. It efficiently handles student 
mark input, performs calculations to determine total and average marks, and assigns
 grades based on predefined criteria. This project showcases essential web development skills, 
including form handling, server-side processing, and dynamic content generation.
